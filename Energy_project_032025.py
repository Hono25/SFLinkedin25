As the world increasingly shifts towards sustainable practices, understanding the progress and potential of clean energy sources is more critical than ever. France, with its ambitious environmental goals and diverse energy portfolio, offers a fascinating case study in this global transition.")
  st.text("In this project, we aim to explore the various facets of renewable energy development within France. We will examine the current state of play, highlighting key technologies, policies, and the impact of these initiatives on the nation's energy independence and environmental footprint. Crucially, we will also investigate how the integration of renewable energy sources affects the reliability of the power grid, analyzing the challenges and solutions related to potential blackouts. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive overview that sheds light on both the achievements and the ongoing challenges in France's journey towards a greener and more secure energy future.")
